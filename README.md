# OCP Infrastructure Provider Onboarding Guide
A guide on how to bring a new infrastructure provider to OpenShift Container Platform.

The documentation in this repository is organized to use the
[Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) site generation tool. In general the site can
be viewed by running `mkdocs serve` from the root of the project repository
and then visiting `http://localhost:8000` with a web browser.

to add an entry in `mkdocs.yml` file under the `nav` section if you will need a
link in the navigation bar (see the
